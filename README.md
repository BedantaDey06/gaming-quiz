# Py Game Quiz
A gaming quiz built in Python. It is mainly uploaded to help people understand how to curate a quiz on Python.

This is a quiz having 6 questions. They cover all aspects of gaming.

NOTE: This is a fully functional source code of how to make quizzes in Python. Uploading a bland code would be dumb and boring, so I thought to make it a fully fletched game quiz instead! You can still modify it.
